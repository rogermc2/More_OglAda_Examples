# Additional OpenGLAda Examples

This repository contains examples for [OpenGLAda][1].
This repository contains additional examples to those contained in [OpenGLAda-Examples][2].
These examples have mostly been translated from C examples from OpenGL textbooks.

## Building

OpenGLAda must be present on your machine to be able to build these examples. `GPR_PROJECT_PATH` needs to include the path to OpenGLAda.

All examples use the GLFW library which must be available on your system.

Each example has a separate `.gpr` file with which it can be built.

Depending on the OpenGL version of your platform, the shader programs may need modifications to run.
